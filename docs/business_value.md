# Business Value Narrative

### How the model aligns with organisational goals
1. **Operational throughput** – Automated classification allows WMCN to increase conveyor speed by ≈ 15 %, lowering labour costs.  
2. **Revenue uplift** – 1 % purity improvement raises PET-plastic bale price ~€12 / tonne.  
3. **Regulatory compliance** – Meeting the Dutch Ministry’s 2025 recycling-rate statute avoids €500 k annual fines.  
4. **Brand equity** – Transparent XAI builds resident trust in WMCN’s “green tech” ambitions.
